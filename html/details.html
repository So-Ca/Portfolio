      <h3>INFORMATICS</h3>
      <p>
        I have always had a strong affinity for computers: their minimalistic design, the hardware and unboxing them. Moreover, you can accomplish nearly anything with these machines.<br>
        From an early age, I was captivated by the multitude of functions a computer could perform, from simply turning on a light on the desktop to controlling entire automated buildings. In the last two decades, its potential has skyrocketed even further.<br>
        I've always wanted to understand how communication works between a computer and its counterparts, those that perform the tasks. Unfortunately, I never mustered the courage to embark on a study path focused on this subject. This hesitation stemmed from my childhood, when I was uncertain about my future career, and continued into adulthood, as I felt apprehensive about restarting my studies and reentering the academic world.<br>
        However, I have recently come to realize the folly of not even trying. Consequently, I decided to commence a new course of study in computer science, starting with what I considered the easiest entry point. I intend to gradually expand this knowledge, which I have long admired.<br>
        With this perspective in mind, I embarked on a course with <i>Start2Impact University</i> as a <b>Front End Web Developer</b>.<br>
        This website represents my journey of learning in the field of computer science, and it will be continuously updated with additional content in parallel with my progress and the expansion of my knowledge.

      <h3>DIGITAL SKILLS</h3>
      <p>
        I hold ECDL & CAD certificates from the CFIQ in Pinerolo (TO), demonstrating my proficiency in using software applications such as Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Outlook, and AutoCAD. I am adept at using different operating systems, including Linux Mint and Ubuntu (the latter being my favorite). Additionally, I possess hardware maintenance and configuration skills.

      <h3>INTERNATIONAL LITERACY</h3>
      <p>
        As a native Italian speaker, I am fluent in Italian. However, I also have a good command of other languages:
  
        - I achieved the English C1 Advanced certification during my time in Australia.
        - I attained a French B1 certification during high school.
      </p>

    <div class="chemistry">
      <h3>FOOD BIOCHEMESTRY</h3>
      <p>
        My primary expertise lies in food biochemistry. I excel in cooking and transforming food through natural chemical processes, a skill developed through my passion for gastronomy. I hold a degree in food biochemistry and have completed four master's programs in molecular cuisine, healthy cuisine, physiology, dietology and biophysics. I enjoy preparing elaborate and delicious meals purely for the pleasure of it.<br>
        You may wonder why I don't work in the restaurant industry. While I used to, I eventually realized that pursuing this path was draining the joy out of something I once loved. Thus, I made the decision to break away from this counterproductive pattern and embark on a new career in a field that truly resonates with me.
