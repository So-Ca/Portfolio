    <div class="skills-info">
      Here below there are some information about my knowhow, how I got them and why.
    </div>

    <div class="skill-1">
      <h3>INFORMATICS</h3>
      <p>
        I always loved the computer, the boxes, unboxing them, their minimal line, and also you can do pretty much everything with that machine. 
        Since I was young I've been drawn to all the functions a computer can perform, from turning on a light on the desktop to activating entire automated buildings, and especially in the last twenty years his potential has skyrocketed.<br>
        I've always wanted to learn how communication works between a computer and his counterpart that does the job, but unfortunately I've never had the courage to start a study path about it.<br>
        This is because in my childhood I didn't know what job I wanted to do and, as an adult, I was always ashamed to start my studies over and get back into the game.<br>
        But lately I've realized that is very stupid not to even try, so I decided to start a new course of study in computer science, starting from what I considered easiest to start and then continue developing the knowledge that I admired so much.<br>
        With this perspective I've begun my course with <i>Start2Impact University</i> as a <b>Front End Web Developer</b> and, this page is my very fist work that will be updated with more content proceeding in parallel with my new knowledge.<br>
      </p>

      <p class="list">
      These are my skill so far:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS/SASS</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <li>Webpack</li>
        <li>Node</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="list">
        Then I will start with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>React</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="skill-2">
      <h3>DIGITAL SKILLS</h3>
      <p>
        I've got the ECDL & CAD certificate at the CFIQ in Pinerolo (TO), acquiring to use softwares as Excell, Word, PowerPoint, Outlook and Autocad.<br>
        I'm able to use properly some version of different operative system such as Linux Mint and Ubuntu, wich is my favorite.<br>
        I can also do hardware maintenance and setting.
      </p>

    <div class="skill-3">
      <h3>INTERNATIONAL LITERACY</h3>
      <p>
        I am italian mother tongue, so I usually speak italian, but I've got confidential with some other idioms: <br>
        I've got the English C1 Advanced certification when I have been in Australia and I got the French B1 from the high school.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="skill-4">
      <h3>FOOD BIOCHEMESTRY</h3>
      <p>
        This is my main skill.
        I'm very good cooking and transforming food through natural chemical processes, and this thanks to my passion for good food and my degree in food biochemistry and four master in molecular cuisine, healthy cuisine, physiology and dietology.<br>
        I like to prepare meals and make them fancy looking and fancy tasting as well, just for fun<br>
        So, why I don't work in the restaurant branch?<br>
        I actually use to, but even if I like to cook, this isn't my way, over the years I have realized that I was wasting my life doing something that I didn't really like and make me hate what I once liked.<br>
        So I decided to quit with this nonsense behavior and start with a new job in a field that I love.
